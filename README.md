# Deprecated! 

This Go codebase won't see any further development by us. If you've come here looking to run the Nym mixnet, what you really want is our [new Rust codebase](https://github.com/nymtech/nym).

## Anonymous messaging using mix networks

This is an implementation of a private communications system based on
Ania Piotrowska's PhD research. It implements a 
[Loopix](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00536) mixnet as well as the 
[Sphinx](https://cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/Sphinx_Oakland09.pdf) packet format.

## Setup
